## Add locales to Linux

To use some functions, you have to install all needed locales in your OS. This is how to do that on Linux (probably, the same should work for OS X):

1. Check if the locale is installed: `locale -a`. If you see the locale in the list, you don't need to do anything else.
1. If the locale is not in the list, generate it: `sudo locale-gen ru_RU.UTF-8`.
